# Clipboard Meter
**Clipboard Meter Gadget inspired by the well-known AddGadgets.com Windows Sidebar gadgets.**

The Clipboard Meter Gadget is a collaboration between [Eclectic-Tech](https://eclectic-tech.deviantart.com) and myself, based on his [Illustro Clipboard+](http://fav.me/daoug6l) skin with styling to match the [Gadgets](https://github.com/SilverAzide/Gadgets) suite.

**NOTE:**<br>
The installer is in the form of a patch, which will patch your existing [Gadgets](https://github.com/SilverAzide/Gadgets) installation without affecting your existing configuration or layouts. If you don't have the Gadgets suite installed, this will install as a standalone skin.

## Features
* Manages up to 10 items copied to your clipboard.
* Supports text, images, files, and data.
* Left-click a clip to move it to the top of the stack and onto your Windows clipboard, then paste it where you want.
* Middle-click any unselected clip to delete it from the stack.
* Double-click the clipboard icon to clear all clips and your Windows clipboard.
* Allows setting to topmost window position.
* Configurable tooltips show the text of multi-line clips.
* Scales to any desired size.

## Requirements
Rainmeter 4.4.0 or later: <https://www.rainmeter.net>.<br>
